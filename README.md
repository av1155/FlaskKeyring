## Features and Functionality

### User Authentication

-   Robust registration and login systems.
-   Secure password reset with email integration.

### Password Management

-   Encrypted storage and management of passwords.
-   Intuitive user interface for adding, editing, and deleting password entries.
-   Password generation algorithms and efficient search functionalities.

### Database Structure

FlaskKeyring employs an SQLite database to efficiently store and manage user data. The database schema is structured as follows:

#### `users` Table

-   The `users` table stores user account information, including:
    -   `id`: An auto-incremented primary key for each user.
    -   `email`: The email address associated with the user's account (unique).
    -   `username`: The username chosen by the user for their account.
    -   `password_hash`: The securely hashed and salted password, ensuring password confidentiality.

#### `passwords` Table

-   The `passwords` table stores user-specific password entries and their associated data, including:
    -   `id`: An auto-incremented primary key for each password entry.
    -   `user_id`: A foreign key referencing the user to whom the password entry belongs.
    -   `website`: The website or platform associated with the password.
    -   `username`: The username or login ID used for the website.
    -   `password`: The encrypted password, which is stored securely using Fernet encryption.

#### `reset_tokens` Table

-   The `reset_tokens` table is used for password reset functionality, containing:
    -   `id`: An auto-incremented primary key for each reset token.
    -   `user_id`: A foreign key referencing the user for whom the reset token is generated.
    -   `token`: A unique token generated for the password reset request.
    -   `expires_at`: The expiration timestamp of the reset token, set to the current timestamp by default.

The database structure in FlaskKeyring is meticulously designed to maintain data integrity, security, and efficient retrieval while offering a robust foundation for password management and user authentication. It exemplifies the application's commitment to data security and privacy.

### Fernet Password Encryption and Keys

FlaskKeyring places a paramount emphasis on the security and privacy of user data, particularly when it comes to storing passwords. This is achieved through the use of Fernet encryption.

-   **Fernet Encryption**: Fernet is a symmetric (same key for both encryption and decryption) cryptographic method that ensures secure data encryption and decryption. FlaskKeyring utilizes Fernet encryption to safeguard user passwords before storing them in the database.
-   **Encryption Keys**: The security of Fernet encryption relies on the use of encryption keys. In the context of FlaskKeyring, encryption keys are generated and managed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of stored passwords.

    -   **Key Generation**: FlaskKeyring generates encryption keys as part of the password management process. These keys are unique for each password entry and are used to encrypt and decrypt the password data.
    -   **Key Management**: The application maintains a secure method for generating, storing, and managing encryption keys. This ensures that only authorized users can access and decrypt their password information.

By employing Fernet encryption and effectively managing encryption keys, FlaskKeyring guarantees that user passwords remain confidential and secure.

### Templating and Dynamic Content

The Templates Directory in FlaskKeyring plays a crucial role in providing a dynamic and interactive user experience. Each HTML template is meticulously designed to serve specific functionalities:

-   **`layout.html`**: The foundation of the application's UI, it provides a consistent structure and layout across the application, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
-   **`index.html`**: The landing page of the application, welcoming users with a clear and engaging interface, offering options to register or log in.
-   **`dashboard.html`**: The central hub for users, presenting a comprehensive interface for managing stored passwords and accessing various functionalities.
-   **`login.html`** and **`register.html`**: Key to the user authentication process, these templates feature forms for user login and new user registration, respectively.
-   **`change_password.html`**: Facilitates secure password changes for users, showcasing a user-friendly form and secure interaction.
-   **`reset_password.html`**: Designed for users to securely reset their passwords, integrating seamless forms and interactions for a smooth user experience.
-   **`view_passwords.html`**: Enables users to view and manage their stored password entries, demonstrating the core functionality of the application.
-   **`forgot_password.html`**: Offers a dedicated interface for users to initiate the password recovery process.
-   **`edit_password.html`**: Allows users to edit existing password entries, ensuring easy management and updates of stored information.

Each template is integrated with Flask's Jinja2 templating engine, allowing dynamic content rendering and interactive user experiences. This thoughtful organization and design of the templates directory underscore the application's focus on user-centric design and functionality.
