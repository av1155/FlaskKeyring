## Introduction

FlaskKeyring, crafted solely by Andrea Arturo Venti Fuentes, showcases an advanced, full-stack password management solution that adheres to cutting-edge security principles, including client-side encryption. Built using Python and Flask, FlaskKeyring is designed with the user in mind, providing a robust, intuitive, and highly secure platform for managing passwords. The project is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at [https://flaskkeyring.tech](https://flaskkeyring.tech), demonstrating its scalability and readiness for production.

## Core Technologies

### Python and Flask

-   **Python**: Powers the backend with robust functionality for data processing, encryption, and complex server-side logic.
-   **Flask**: The chosen framework for its balance between simplicity and flexibility, handling server operations with efficiency and scalability in mind.

### Full-Stack Mastery

-   **Frontend Excellence**: Designed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, FlaskKeyring offers a responsive, clean, and user-centric interface, prioritizing usability and user experience.
-   **Backend Complexity**: The backend efficiently handles secure data processing, user authentication, encryption, and RESTful API endpoints, showcasing proficiency in managing both the functional and security needs of a web application.

### Database and ORM

-   **PostgreSQL & SQLAlchemy**: Provides robust and secure database management, with advanced ORM techniques ensuring data integrity and seamless interactions between the application and database.
-   **SQLite**: Employed for local testing to streamline feature development and testing workflows.

### Security and Client-Side Encryption

-   **Zero-Knowledge Security Model**: Implements client-side encryption, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, no plaintext passwords can be decrypted without the userâ€™s master password.
-   **Advanced Cryptographic Techniques**: Uses AES-GCM encryption via the Web Cryptography API, deriving encryption keys client-side from a master password that is never sent to the server. This means that password data remains inaccessible without the client-side key derived from the master password.
-   **Session Management**: Integrates Flask-Login and Flask-Session to manage user sessions securely and guard against unauthorized access.
-   **Fernet Keys**: Each user has a Fernet key stored server-side, utilized for additional non-password encryption needs such as encrypting sensitive data linked to account settings. However, it is not involved in primary password encryption, reinforcing the zero-knowledge security model.

### Email Capabilities

-   **Flask-Mail Integration**: Facilitates automated, secure email notifications for account verification and password reset requests, enhancing user experience and security.

## Skills Demonstrated

-   **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
-   **Frameworks**: Flask, Bootstrap
-   **Database & ORM**: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
-   **Encryption & Security**: AES-GCM, PBKDF2, Web Cryptography API, Fernet Keys, Zero-Knowledge Security Model
-   **Backend Development**: RESTful API design, Flask-Login, Flask-Session, Flask-Mail integration
-   **Frontend Development**: Responsive design, client-side JavaScript for encryption, dynamic templating with Jinja2
-   **Full-Stack Expertise**: End-to-end application architecture, secure session management, user authentication
-   **Deployment & Hosting**: Heroku, version control with Git
-   **Project Management**: Modular code organization, scalability, maintainability, security-first design principles

## Deployment and Hosting

-   **Heroku**: Chosen for its scalable, cloud-based deployment capabilities, allowing FlaskKeyring to function efficiently in a production environment with seamless scalability.

## Features and Functionality

### Zero-Knowledge User Authentication

-   **Complete Authentication System**: Secure registration, login, and password reset functionalities integrated with email verification for account security.
-   **Client-Side Encryption for Passwords**: Passwords are encrypted client-side using AES-GCM before transmission to the server, where only encrypted data is stored. Even database administrators cannot decrypt passwords without the master password.

### Advanced Password Management

-   **Secure Storage of Encrypted Data**: Encrypts passwords, IV, and salt client-side to ensure that only ciphertext is stored on the server.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a seamless experience for adding, editing, and deleting passwords with real-time updates and visual feedback.
-   **Password Generation and Search**: Implements secure password generation and efficient search functionalities to streamline user experience.

### Database Structure and Security

-   **User Data Integrity**: Contains structured tables including `users`, `passwords`, `reset_tokens`, `folders`, and `fernet_keys` to organize and protect sensitive information.
-   **Only Encrypted Data Stored**: Ensures compliance with best practices for zero-knowledge encryption by storing only ciphertext and decryption parameters (`iv` and `salt`).

### Encryption and Security Details

-   **Client-Side AES-GCM Encryption**: Using the Web Cryptography API, passwords are encrypted on the client side before reaching the server.
-   **Password Derivation Using PBKDF2**: Derives encryption keys client-side from a master password and a unique salt, reinforcing a zero-knowledge approach where decryption requires the master password, which is never stored or transmitted.

### Dynamic Templating and Modularity

-   **Jinja2 Integration**: Templates are dynamically rendered for seamless navigation and an interactive user experience, from `dashboard.html` to `view_passwords.html`.
-   **Flask Blueprints**: Modular structure organizes routes into logical sections, following best practices in Flask for maintainability and scalability.

## Project Design and Structure

-   **Modular and Maintainable Code**: Organized with separate modules for models, views, and utilities, enhancing code readability and scalability.
-   **Security-First Development**: Designed with a strong focus on security, implementing client-side encryption, secure session management, and email verification to protect user data.
-   **Advanced JavaScript and Web Crypto API Use**: Demonstrates expertise in advanced JavaScript, leveraging the Web Cryptography API to implement secure client-side encryption for password management.

## Conclusion

FlaskKeyring is a comprehensive password management solution that goes beyond typical web applications by prioritizing client-side encryption and zero-knowledge security. Every detail, from frontend aesthetics to backend encryption logic, reflects a sophisticated understanding of full-stack development and cybersecurity principles. FlaskKeyring exemplifies a robust, scalable, and secure solution built for real-world application, underscoring my full-stack development skills and commitment to secure, user-friendly applications.
